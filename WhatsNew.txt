              Alt+Z   Menu > Edit > Undo
        Shift+Alt+Z   Menu > Edit > Redo

              Alt+X   Menu > Edit > Cut
              Alt+C   Menu > Edit > Copy
              Alt+V   Menu > Edit > Paste

              Alt+F   Menu > Edit > Find first ...

              Alt+L   Menu > Run > Load current script

     Why is the Alt key used instead of the familiar Ctrl key?
     Most browsers do have many pre-defined keyboard shortcuts
     using Ctrl+<key>. It's not the best idea to to overwrite
     these definitions.
     So I decided to use familiar shortcut keys, prefixed with
     the Alt key instead of the Ctrl key.

     Due to security reasons, JavaScript does not have access
     to the clipboard. When using familiar shortcuts like Ctrl+X
     (Cut), Ctrl+C (Copy) and Ctrl+V (Paste), the system-
     clipboard is used.
     When using Menu>Edit>Cut/Copy/Paste, and the corresponding
     shortcuts (Alt+X, Alt+C, Alt+V) an internal text clipboard
     is used.
     As an advantage, you will have two clipboards.
